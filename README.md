# Computer Graphics
CSE423: Computer Graphics Course


Tried some of the basic graphics drawing using Rust. Currently wrote only Rectange, DDA Line, Midpoint Line, Midpoint Circle.

## Just Rectangle

Drawn using build in line drawing method. This was used to get idea about the location are orientation of the drawing.
